Paper about Global Names Parser
===============================

Open Access/Open Science paper about [gnparser]

Issues look better with [ZenHub][zenhub]

Introduction
------------

We just released a new [GlobalNames][gn] project and now writing paper about it.
It is more fun to write paper the same way as we write code -- keep changes
under revision control, give full and early access to the data for everyone to
see. This is how we program, lets see how it works for scientific literature.

It is possible just to look at the [text of the paper][paper] on GitHub, or in
a text editor, however there is a secondary Git repository at OverLeaf which
generates PDF and makes it [publicly available][overleaf].
